### Participation

Chicago is home to many professional organizations for informatics practitioners, as well as health care organizations that are involved in the development and application of informatics standards. In addition to the many health care providers in Chicago who use informatics-based tools, there are a number of corporations that either provide informatics solutions, or hire informatics professionals.  See our [sponsors list](./sponsors.html) to learn more.

### Leadership

Dr. Justin Starren, Chief of the Division of Health and Biomedical Informatics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Frank Naeymi-Rad, Chairman and CEO of Intelligent Medical Objects serve as co-chairs of the Informatics Week Committee.

### About Biomedical Informatics:

Biomedical and Health Informatics is a broad interdisciplinary field. The most current formal definition can be found in a [recent paper from the AMIA Academic Forum](http://jamia.bmj.com/content/early/2012/06/20/amiajnl-2012-001053.full):

"Definition: Biomedical informatics (BMI) is the interdisciplinary field that studies and pursues the effective uses of biomedical data, information, and knowledge for scientific inquiry, problem solving, and decision making, driven by efforts to improve human health.

* Scope and breadth of discipline: BMI investigates and supports reasoning, modeling, simulation, experimentation, and translation across the spectrum from molecules to individuals and to populations, from biological to social systems, bridging basic and clinical research and practice and the healthcare enterprise.
* Theory and methodology: BMI develops, studies, and applies theories, methods, and processes for the generation, storage, retrieval, use, management, and sharing of biomedical data, information, and knowledge.
* Technological approach: BMI builds on and contributes to computer, telecommunication, and information sciences and technologies, emphasizing their application in biomedicine.
* Human and social context: BMI, recognizing that people are the ultimate users of biomedical information, draws upon the social and behavioral sciences to inform the design and evaluation of technical solutions, policies, and the evolution of economic, ethical, social, educational, and organizational systems."

In practical terms, Biomedical and Health Informatics is about developing better methods to user data, information, and knowledge to solve practical problems in healthcare and biomedical research.

### About AMIA

[The American Medical Informatics Association](http://www.amia.org), the leading professional association for informatics professionals, serves as the voice of the nation's top biomedical and health informatics professionals and plays an important role in medicine, health care, and science, encouraging the use of data, information and knowledge to improve both human health and delivery of healthcare services.
