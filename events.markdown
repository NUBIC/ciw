### EECS Seminar: Informatics Career

Location: TECH L324, Northwestern University's Evanston, IL Campus


Justin Starren, MD, PhD, Chief of the Division of Health and Biomedical Informatics, Director Northwestern University Biomedical Informatics Center (NUBIC), and Director of the new PhD program in Health and Biomedical Informatics, Northwestern University

As part of Informatics Week, the Division of Health and Biomedical Informatics will be offering career talks about Informatics as a career. Informatics is the study of information: how you collect it, organize it, and use it to solve problems.  Health and Biomedical Informatics (identified as one of the hottest growth fields in many publications), is informatics applied to healthcare and biomedical research, and developing better methods to user data, information, and knowledge to solve practical problems in healthcare and biomedical research.  The career talk will last approximately 30 minutes, allowing time for questions.

A lunch (pizza/sodas) will be served at 11:50 a.m., and is being sponsored by Division of Health and Biomedical Informatics (HBMI).


### Tuesday, October 30, 4:00-5:00 p.m.
### Informatics Jam Session

Prentice Women's Hospital, 250 E Superior, Chicago, IL, 3rd Floor, Conference Room L-South

Northwestern researchers will highlight their informatics research during a round of 60-90 second speed seminars.

A reception will follow in the Atrium.

### INFORMATICS WEEK "WRAP UP"

Informatics Week will wrap up with an in-depth tutorial on the I2B2 software.

We will describe a step by step approach to implementing i2b2 at your institution, what technologies are used and any third party software that is required, such as application or database servers. We will continue by writing a new analytic "cell" and leveraging advanced services such as
natural language processing. The new cell will be a fully working i2b2cell that can receive and respond to i2b2 calls. Once the cell has been developed, an i2b2 webclient plugin will be developed that sends a message to the cell and displays the response. We conclude with a roadmap
for the near term and longer term i2b2 developments.

Due to the complex nature of this tutorial, the participants should download and install the tutorial Virtual Machine (VM; see below) prior to attending. The VM will run on any Windows or Macintosh machine and will contain a complete and installed i2b2 server, i2b2 webclient,
application server, database server and any developments needed. A completed cell and plugin will also be included.

Prerequisites: The participant should download and install the source code of the "i2b2 Tutorial" that is available for download [here](https://www.i2b2.org/software/ctsa2012.html) prior to arriving at the workshop.

Intended Audience: Scientists; researchers; healthcare analysts, database programmers, and other healthcare professionals; academic faculty or professionals setting up bioinformatics facilities and/or relating these to clinical data repositories and computer scientists, system developers,
and programmers.

The workshop is free, but preregistration is required.  Contact [Susanne Churchill](mailto:SCHURCHILL@PARTNERS.ORG).
